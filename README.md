# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Problem Statement

The Twitter Sentiment Analysis project focuses on developing a robust sentiment analysis model for tweets. By harnessing the power of natural language processing (NLP), this project aims to automatically categorize twitter sentiments.

## Dataset

For this project, I utilized a diverse collection of tweets, Twitter dataset from Kaggle. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and validating our sentiment analysis model.

## Model

I incorporated pre-trained embeddings with TensorFlow to enhance accuracy. The strength of this approach lies in its ability to capture nuanced meanings in text, improving sentiment analysis results. Furthermore, I seamlessly integrated the developed model into a user-friendly Streamlit UI application, enabling real-time predictions. This sophisticated yet accessible system aids in quickly identifying tweets that may convey potential disaster scenarios.
